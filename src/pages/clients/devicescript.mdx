# DeviceScript (beta)

**Beta: the python layer is still in pre-release mode and beta quality.**

Microsoft DeviceScript is a TypeScript-like language built on top Jacdac services.

```typescript
const sensor = new ds.AirPressure()
// listen for pressure changes
sensor.pressure.onChange(10, () => {
    // read sensor reading
    const pressure = sensor.pressure.read()
    console.log(pressure)
})
```

## Jacdac and DeviceScript

DeviceScript uses the Jacdac services to provide an abstraction layer between the physical hardware and the scripts.
